## What's the purpose of this repository?

  This repository provides a modified version of the [Remnote Plugin Template React](https://github.com/remnoteio/remnote-plugin-template-react), addressing several issues in the project development.
  
  The original template presented issues during execution, regardless webpack version and configuration, therefore I decided to create this template with the adressed issues.

## How to run the project

- First at all, you need:
  - node version at least version 20
  - pnpm and glob packages

- Once you have covered the requirements:
  - `pnpm i` to install the packages
  - `pnpm run dev` to run the project in development mode
